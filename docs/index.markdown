---
I am Soheun Yi. I major Mathematics at Seoul National University.

I am interested in optimization theory and causal discovery. Especially, I'm trying to find connection between two disciplines.

Currently I am conducting research on monotone operator optimization theory under supervision of professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and causal discovery under supervision of professor [Sanghack Lee][Lee]. 

I have worked as a quantative researcher in a cryptocurrency fund Hyperithm. From conducting cryptocurrency market data analysis, I have built solid background on Python, especially in preprocessing and analyzing large datasets. I also have wide range of programming experience in variety of languages: BigQuery(Regex), C, CUDA, JavaScript, Julia, Rust and TypeScript.

<!-- I enjoy visualizing mathematical concepts. You can check out my trial of [visualization of interpolation methods][na_visualization], programmed in Python and JavaScript(React). -->

Hi! I am Soheun Yi, a second-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interest spans applied statistics and machine learning for sciences.
I am also interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning, especially in optimization theory.

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and [Sanghack Lee][Lee].
I was also a a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm], where I built a solid background in data analysis, especially in processing and analyzing large datasets. 

My [CV](../assets/soheunyi_cv.pdf) is here.

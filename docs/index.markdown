title: About
---
I am Soheun Yi. I major in Mathematics at Seoul National University.

I am interested in optimization theory and causality. I am working to find the connection between the two disciplines.

Currently, I am conducting research on monotone operator optimization theory under the supervision of Professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and causal discovery under the supervision of Professor [Sanghack Lee][Lee]. 

I have worked as a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm]. 
From conducting market data analysis, I have built solid background in Python, especially in processing and analyzing large datasets. 
I also have a wide range of programming experience various languages: BigQuery(Regex), C, CUDA, JavaScript, Julia, Rust, and TypeScript.

# Curriculum Vitae
My [CV](../assets/soheunyi_cv.pdf) is here.

<!-- I enjoy visualizing mathematical concepts. You can check out my trial of [visualization of interpolation methods][na_visualization], programmed in Python and JavaScript(React). -->

Hi! I am Soheun Yi, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interest spans between different (but firmly connected) fields: optimization theory, causality, and, machine learning.

During my undergraduates, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and [Sanghack Lee][Lee].
I was also a a quantitative analyst in [Hyperithm][hyperithm], where I built solid background in data analysis especially in processing and analyzing large datasets.

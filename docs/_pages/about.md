## About
I'm Soheun Yi. I major in Mathematics at Seoul National University.

I have solid background on Python I had built from two years of experience in cryptocurrency market data analysis. I also have programming experience in Rust, JavaScript, Julia, C and CUDA. 

I enjoy visualizing mathematical concepts. You can check out my trial of [visualization of interpolation methods][na_visualization], programmed in Python and JavaScript(React). More interpolation methods might be added in the future.

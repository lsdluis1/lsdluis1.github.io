## About
I'm Soheun Yi. I major in Mathematics at Seoul National University.

Currently I conduct research on monotone operator optimization theory under supervision of professor [Ernest Ryu][Ryu].

I have worked as a quantative researcher in a cryptocurrency fund Hyperithm. From conducting cryptocurrency market data analysis, I have built solid background on Python, especially in preprocessing and analyzing large datasets. I also have wide range of programming experience in variety of languages: BigQuery(Regex), C, CUDA, JavaScript, Julia, Rust and TypeScript.

I enjoy visualizing mathematical concepts. You can check out my trial of [visualization of interpolation methods][na_visualization], programmed in Python and JavaScript(React).

## About
I'm Soheun Yi. I major Mathematics at Seoul National University.

I'm interested in optimization theory and causal discovery. Especially, I'm trying to find connection between two disciplines.

Currently I'm conducting research on monotone operator optimization theory under supervision of professor [Ernest K. Ryu][Ryu] and causal discovery under supervision of professor [Sanghack Lee][Lee]. 

I have worked as a quantative researcher in a cryptocurrency fund Hyperithm. From conducting cryptocurrency market data analysis, I have built solid background on Python, especially in preprocessing and analyzing large datasets. I also have wide range of programming experience in variety of languages: BigQuery(Regex), C, CUDA, JavaScript, Julia, Rust and TypeScript.

<!-- I enjoy visualizing mathematical concepts. You can check out my trial of [visualization of interpolation methods][na_visualization], programmed in Python and JavaScript(React). -->
